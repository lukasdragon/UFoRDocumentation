Welcome to the Urban Forestry R Package (`UFoR`)! This package has been meticulously designed to bridge the gap between urban forestry and cutting-edge technological tools. Whether you're an arborist, urban forester, researcher, or tree care professional, `UFoR` offers you user-friendly tools to transform and streamline your urban forestry tasks.

Explore our comprehensive documentation to learn how to use `UFoR`, understand its functions, contribute to its development, and get information about its license.

Note that the package is still early in development and this documentation is not exhaustive, complete, or even necessarily correct. Please see [contribute](5-contribute.md) if you would like to help out.
